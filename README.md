# GeneticAlgorythm
Genetic Algorithm - Beginnings of genetic Algorithm design model...  

This project is to gain an understanding of genetic algorithms . Here i will be exploring ;

1 dimensional model (text)
2 dimensional models (X,Y)
2 dimensional models (R,G,B)

Can Genetic Algorithms be applied to word pattern learning, sentence generation, NLP tasks ?

in the learning phases applied within this paradigm, it may be prudent to understand that such a paradigm if left unmanaged will develop dynmically, 
such techniques when applied to robotics or machione design can pose a threat in such that, machines which design themselves will eventiually evolve,
into a machine unrecognisable to our personal design idealogy be also be the most practical of machine designs. if applied to artificial intelligence processes,
The foundation and goals set by the methodology for the systems designed will eventually evoilve past the requirement of uman management and the most practical , 
solution to the goals set. Such potential can lead to some unusual .......outcomes.....

the desire to be able to apply this type of paraadigm to learning a task is high!!!

*** the aim is to design a reusable Library *** 

here it would be desireable to have an interface / Abstract class Which can be overwritten with customised ** FITNESS ** / ** CROSSOVER ** / ** MUTATION ** functions etc .....
